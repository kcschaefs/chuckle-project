# chuckle-project

## Description

The chuckle project is designed to ease some boredom by generating random jokes, riddles, or bucket list items. It then allows you to favorite the item with a custom name entry that then populates the favorites page. The index page also contains a small easter egg. The application makes three different API calls for riddles, bucket list items, and jokes. 

## Usage

1. Click the button where you'd like to generate a riddle, joke, or bucket list item.
2. If you'd like to favorite the item click the heart icon.
3. Enter the name you'd like to save the favorite with.
4. Hit 'Submit'

You can view your favorites at any time by clicking the favs button on the top left of the page. 

Favorites page contains a Clear button at the top to remove all favorites, and a back button that returns users to the previous page.
