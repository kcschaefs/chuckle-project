main page ----------------------------------------

html loads three options

click on the parent el target just that event

set the click event on the parent to target the correct api event (joke bucket riddle)
setting a var to do that
build an array with the var options? 

have that click call the api

create a card for the fact
have it serve the fact into the card
show the card
option to favorite the fact in the card -- this will save the fact into local storage to be served onto the favorites page .push (empty heart image)
  favorite icon should act like a checkbox (status checked vs unchecked)
    input popup - need to be able to name the card from user input (use a modal?)
    once named and saved, popup closes on "save button click"
  after favorite named, return to card
  when button clicked, replace with an image (full heart image)
close the card
remove all data served in .empty
back to the "start" of the page

link the favorites button on the background to serve up the favorites page

button click for chuck norris
hide chuck norris until x amount of saved favorites
  set as absolute positioning
array.length >=5, unhide chuck norris button/icon

import certain variables across the js pages as needed

pull needed variables from other js files while building
import { msg, PI, addNumbers } from './main.js';

favorites -----------------------------------------

abilty to unfavorite -- .remove or .empty to remove favorites
  set an event listener on the parent element of the card to target the button class and remove appropriate card
  this will remove it from local storage as well as remove the card
